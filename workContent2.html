        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p class="description">This is a individual project that finished in IAT 233. A 4 pages spread designed individually.
          The project topic is “human and architecture”, so several high-quality photographs are required that convey a concept. </p>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p class="description">It requires us only took photo with architecture and a model included. The font was given, too. Considered all the constraints, a vague vision come across my mind. My very abstract and arbitrary intention was to represents a sense of vigorous freedom. Then It developed into a more specific goal. When cultures from ethnic minority and cultures from developed city collides, the odd cultures tend to stand out. The traditional clothes contradicts general fashion style for most people. The act for one to embrace such difference with pride would appears brave, fearless and rebellious. That is what I would like to represent using the provided techniques and knowledge of design. </p>

          <h3>Problems</h3>
          <p class="description">Using visual content to tell a story is not easy. Design can only communicate well when every single element is well produced.
            Acrossing form the photograph to the layout, everything should have a high-quality and help storytelling.  </p>
            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p class="description">In order to provide such exotic feel to my piece, a deep contrast is necessary.
              I had considered all the possible contrast. Other than the comparison of cultures,
              which can be represented through the inharmonious when comparing the subject’s clothing and identity with the modern concrete architectural design.</p>
              <h3>Learned Lessons</h3>
              <p class="description">With a lot of cropping and working down to details, I learned to use post-production to enhance the concept.
                The light, the contrast, the composition of photo can be revised and improved by using post-production. </p>
