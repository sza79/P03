        <p class="date">13/4/2017 1:29:26 PM.</p>

        <p class="description">The Tracklite is designed to accommodate the needs of construction ironworker using cranes to lift the steel columns for erecting a building structure.</p><p class="hiddenContent">
          Thus the main functionality manifest in the ruggedness and durability of the flashlight. <div class="hidden">Thermoplastic rubber is majorly used because these materials are lightweight
          but can also withstand damages from falling with high strength. The rubberized tube also indicates the tactility of the interaction and extends the service life of the
          flashlight, with tolerance to high temperature and risky daily use of construction workers.
          This is a group project from IAT 336. We followed the whole process of iteration: sketching, prototyping, modeling, finalizing. After we decided which sketch we would work
          on, we made a physical model at first. Since we got a lot of feedbacks from critique session for improving the functions, we began to build digital prototypes in Maya.
          Finally, we got the finalized project done and made the poster.</div></p>

          <p class="description">This is an individual work. Considered all the constraints, a vague vision come across my mind.
            My very abstract and arbitrary intention was to represents a sense of vigorous freedom. Then It developed into a more
            specific goal. When cultures from ethnic minority and cultures from developed city collides, the odd cultures tend to
            stand out. The traditional clothes contradicts general fashion style for most people. The act for one to embrace such
            difference with pride would appears brave, fearless and rebellious. That is what I would like to represent using the provided
            techniques and knowledge of design. In order to provide such exotic feel to my piece, a deep contrast is necessary. I had considered
            all the possible contrast. Other than the comparison of cultures, which can be represented through the inharmonious when comparing
            the subjectâ€™s clothing and identity with the modern concrete architectural design. I can also implements additional contrast to emphasise
             the theme, such as the shift between a filled background and an empty background; the rapid change of the size of the subject; the composition;
             the facial and body expression of the subject and of course the light and dark contrast. Also, as basic design consideration, I attempted to use
              type, underlying structures and white space to presents my pieces in a clean and clear environment. </p>
