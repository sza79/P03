        <h3>Brief </h3>
        <p class="description">This is a game design project developed by 4 group members in IAT 410 within 3 one semester. It’s a 3D adventure game that contains 3 levels.  The concept of the game is to play as a giant monster made of hybrid animal genes and destroy cities across the world. Players enter a lab to create these monsters by combining two genes from 5 possible animals. They will then choose a city from the world map to play in, and work toward completing the level by destroying the city’s main monuments before time runs out.

          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p class="description">
          The game needs to be totally created by us including all the artwork. The time limit is 12 weeks, and all of us are taking other 2 courses at the same time. We had to plan out clearly about what features we want to include and work on those possible one.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p class="description">
                The biggest problem we met is the game became too lagging after we applied all the 3D models to the game. We looked for some ways to optimize the game, but most of them suggest doing it while making model, which means in order to solve the problem we have to do all the models all over again. This happened 2 weeks before final showcase, so it’s impossible to re-do all the 3D models.

                  <h3>Solutions</h3>
                  <p class="description">
                    We looked at the models that contain too many polycounts, and those that do not influence the aesthetics of the game. We revised them by reducing the polycounts of them, and the performance of game had been improved.

                      <p class="description">
                        My major job in this team are making 3D models and building terrains. I was a beginner of 3D modeling, so it was a challenge for me to make most buildings of our game. I also revised the terrain and the whole game environment again and again to achieve a sophisticated aesthetic level.

                          <h3>Learned Lessons</h3>
                          <p class="description">
                            The game landed well at the final showcase, some judges from game industry gave us a lot positive comments about our game concept and game mechanics. We also receive the people’s choice award at the final showcase.
We have several parts that are not perfect. A lot playtester mentioned out UI design is hard to understand and the aesthetics of our game is not unified. The reason is we didn’t distribute the job reasonably. The person who are good at UI design in our team worked so hard on our character modeling because we have 5 animals and 10 types of combination, so the UI design has been left to the last minute. Also, we have 2 people who work on modeling and we didn’t literally communicate well about the aesthetics style using a visualized way at the beginning of semester. So if we have more time, I will choose to unify the aesthetics style of the game.
