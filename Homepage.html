<p>The Tracklite is designed to accommodate the needs of construction ironworker using cranes to lift the steel columns for erecting a building structure, thus the main functionality manifest in the ruggedness and durability of the flashlight. Thermoplastic rubber is majorly used because these materials are lightweight but can also withstand damages from falling with high strength. The rubberized tube also indicates the tactility of the interaction and extends the service life of the flashlight, with tolerance to high temperature and risky daily use of construction workers.
This is a group project from IAT 336. We followed the whole process of iteration: sketching, prototyping, modeling, finalizing. After we decided which sketch we would work on, we made a physical model at first. Since we got a lot of feedbacks from critique session for improving the functions, we began to build digital prototypes in Maya. Finally, we got the finalized project done and made the poster.

    <h1>P02 Spread </h1>
<p>This is an individual work. Considered all the constraints, a vague vision come across my mind. My very abstract and arbitrary intention was to represents a sense of vigorous freedom. Then It developed into a more specific goal. When cultures from ethnic minority and cultures from developed city collides, the odd cultures tend to stand out. The traditional clothes contradicts general fashion style for most people. The act for one to embrace such difference with pride would appears brave, fearless and rebellious. That is what I would like to represent using the provided techniques and knowledge of design. In order to provide such exotic feel to my piece, a deep contrast is necessary. I had considered all the possible contrast. Other than the comparison of cultures, which can be represented through the inharmonious when comparing the subject’s clothing and identity with the modern concrete architectural design. I can also implements additional contrast to emphasise the theme, such as the shift between a filled background and an empty background; the rapid change of the size of the subject; the composition; the facial and body expression of the subject and of course the light and dark contrast. Also, as basic design consideration, I attempted to use type, underlying structures and white space to presents my pieces in a clean and clear environment. With a lot of cropping and working down to details, I tried my best to present the best composition I can do for now. All my pieces have contrast in terms of their composition, brightness, subject’s expressions, backgrounds, angles. Underlying structure allows me to align my pieces into structures and avoid floating around, while the type and white space created hierarchy to my design, making it visually pleasing.
